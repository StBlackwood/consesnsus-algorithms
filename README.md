# Consensus Algorithms (Learning Project)

This repository is a personal exploration of various consensus algorithms used in distributed systems, such as Raft and ZooKeeper-based approaches.

## Goals

- Understand the internal workings of consensus protocols
- Gain hands-on experience implementing and testing distributed algorithms
- Explore techniques for leader election, replication, and fault tolerance

## Technologies

- Go (Golang)
- gRPC
- zookeeper
